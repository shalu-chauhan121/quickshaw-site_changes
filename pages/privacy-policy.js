                reliably and legally. Below are the categories plus
                plain-English examples of when we collect them.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <strong>3.1 Account & Identity</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Collected: at sign-up/driver onboarding (example: name, mobile
                  number, email, profile photo).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Purpose: account creation, identity verification, legitimate
                  contact.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Example: When you sign up we verify your phone with an OTP and
                  store the phone hash and metadata.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div>
              <strong>3.2 Payment & Financial</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Collected: tokenized card data, UPI ID, bank account (for
                  driver payouts), transaction IDs.
                </li>
                <li>Purpose: to charge fares, pay drivers, support refunds.</li>
                <li>
                  Handling: raw card PANs are never stored on QuickShaw servers
                  - tokens from PCI-DSS-compliant processors only.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div>
              <strong>3.3 Location & Trip Telemetry</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Collected: real-time GPS while app is running and during
                  active trips, start/end coordinates, route, timestamps.
                </li>

                  Example: While a trip is active the app transmits the rider &
                  driver GPS every X seconds (configurable). After trip, precise
                  coordinates are retained per retention rules; aggregated
                  geohashes are used for heat-map analytics.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div>

                </li>
                <li>
                  Purpose: incident resolution, dispute handling, law

                  docs are stored encrypted.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h2>4. How We Collect Data</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>Direct input: you type it into the app or upload docs.</li>
                <li>
                  Automated telemetry: the app collects GPS and device
                  diagnostics while in use.
                </li>
                <li>
                  From partners: background-check vendors, payment gateways,
                  mapping providers.
                </li>
                <li>
                  From other users: ratings or incident reports that mention
                  another user or driver.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Public sources: for compliance checks, as permitted by law.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                We aim to collect the minimum necessary and where possible, use
                privacy-preserving forms (e.g., coarse geohash instead of
                precise coordinates for historical analytics).
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h2>5. Legal Bases & Purposes</h2>
              <p>
                Below is the mapping we follow so each processing activity has a
                lawful basis and purpose:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Contractual Necessity to execute the Terms of Service: trip
                  matching, payment facilitation, receipts, refunds.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Legal Obligation to comply with tax, regulatory, law
                  enforcement requests, audit retention.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Consent for marketing messages, targeted advertising, optional
                  safety audio uploads, or sensitive data collection beyond what
                  law mandates. Consent is captured explicitly and auditable.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Legitimate Interests for fraud detection, safety monitoring,
                  product improvement. We balance interests with rights via
                  DPIAs and opt-outs where appropriate.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>Examples:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Trip telemetry: Contractual necessity & legitimate interest
                  (safety).
                </li>
                <li>Marketing emails: Consent (opt-in; can withdraw).</li>
                <li>
                  Driver licence copy: Legal obligation + contractual necessity
                  for onboarding.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h2>6. Consent - how we obtain & record it</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Consent is collected in-app via clear, plain-language prompts
                  and checkboxes (no pre-ticked boxes).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Each consent event is logged with timestamp, app version, user
                  id, and the privacy text shown (audit trail).
                </li>
                <li>
                  For sensitive data (e.g., government ID), consent dialogs
                  explain the retention period and purpose and link to this
                  Policy.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Users can review and withdraw consent from the Privacy
                  Dashboard (in-app) and we honor revocations prospectively.
                </li>
              </ul>
